								<h3>Gozinaki (Walnut Honey Brittle for the Holidays)</h3>
								<br>
								<b>Ingredients</b><br>
								3 cups walnuts<br>
								¾ cup honey<br>
								1 tablespoon sugar<br>
								<br>
								<b>How to Make the Gozinaki:</b><br>
								<br>
								<ol>
								<li>Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Spread the chopped walnuts on a baking sheet and bake for ten minutes. Stir the walnuts and move them around with a wooden spoon until they are slightly toasted. Chop the walnuts into small pieces.</li>
								<li>Bring the honey to a boil in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir the honey with a wooden spoon or spatula while it comes to a boil. Lower the heat, add the sugar, and stir.</li>
								<li>Slowly add the chopped walnuts to the honey and mix them until they are coated with the honey mixture.</li> 
								<li>Add water to the surface of a wooden cutting board and spread the walnut and honey mixture onto it. Use wet hands or a wet spoon to flatten the mixture. Use a rolling pin wettened with water to flatten the mixture more until it is about ⅓ inch thick.</li>
								<li>Run a knife under very hot water and cut the gozinaki into diagonal strips, then vertical strips, to make a diamond shape.</li>
								</ol>

								<h3>Cigareti (Rolled Walnut-Filled Pastries)</h3>
								<br>
								<b>Dough Ingredients</b><br>
								2 cups all-purpose flour<br>
								¼ teaspoon salt<br>
								1 stick cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces <br>
								1/2 cup whole milk sour cream<br>
								1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
								<br>
								<b>Filling Ingredients</b><br>
								1 egg white<br>
								½ cup granulated sugar<br>
								1 cup shelled walnuts, ground in a food processor<br>
								2 tablespoons confectioner’s sugar<br>
								<br>
								<b>How to Make the Rolled Walnut-Filled Pastries</b><br>
								<br>
								<ol>
								<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Pour the unsalted flour and salt onto a surface. Use a stainless steel scraper to mix the chopped cold unsalted butter into the flour mixture. Use the scraper to incorporate the butter into the flour well.</li>
								<li>Mix the sour cream and vanilla extract into the flour mixture using the scraper and knead with your hands until a dough comes together. Form it into a ball, put it into a bowl, cover it and refrigerate it for 30 minutes.</li>
								<li>Take one egg white, put it into a bowl and slightly whisk it. Add the granulated sugar and keep whisking. Add in the ground walnuts and mix well.</li>
								<li>Take the dough out of the refrigerator, divide it into two balls. Roll out one of the balls until it is about ¼ inch thin. Take a sharp knife and cut the circle into 12ths like a pie.</li>
								<li>Place about a tablespoon of the walnut mixture at the end/thicker half of the cut dough pieces and roll them up. Repeat with the second circle of dough. Place the rolled up pastries, not touching each other, onto a parchment paper on a baking sheet. Place in the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes. Dust with confectioner’s sugar and enjoy.</li>
