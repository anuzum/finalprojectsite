								<h3>Lobio (Red Kidney Bean Stew)</h3>
								<br>
								<b>Ingredients</b><br>
								12 ounces dry red kidney beans<br>
								¼ tablespoon of chili or cayenne<br>
								1 cup fresh chopped cilantro<br>
								1½ cups chopped onion<br>
								½ teaspoon crushed coriander<br>
								4 garlic cloves, chopped<br>
								½ teaspoon fenugreek<br>
								2 bay leaves<br>
								Salt and pepper to taste<br>
								<br>
								<p><b>How to Make the Lobio:</b></p>
								<ol>
 								 <li>Soak the beans overnight in a large pot. Drain and rinse the beans. Fill up the pot with water that covers one inch on top of the beans. Bring to a boil, let it boil for about 5 minutes until foam forms, then dump out the water and refill with fresh water. Rinse the beans with water in a colander. Cover the beans with fresh water once more, add the bay leaves, bring to a boil then simmer on high for one hour, making sure to skim the foam.</li>
								 <li>Add in all of the spices and half of the chopped cilantro, half of the chopped onion, and half of the chopped garlic. Continue simmering for one more hour. If needed, add more water to keep the beans covered by about one inch with liquid.</li>
								 <li>Sauté the remaining garlic and onion in olive oil until golden. Stir the sautéed garlic and onions into the bean stew. Add the remaining chopped cilantro. Cook for five more minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>

								<h3>Khinkali (Meat-Filled Dumplings)</h3>
								<br>
								<b>Dough Ingredients</b><br>
								2 cups all purpose flour<br>
								1 large egg, room temperature<br>
								½ cup water<br>
								Salt to taste<br>
								<br>
								<b>Meat Filling Ingredients</b>
								4 ounces ground beef<br>
								4 ounces ground pork<br>
								½ cup minced onion<br>
								3 tablespoons melted butter<br>
								½ cup water or beef or chicken broth<br>
								½ cup chopped fresh cilantro<br>
								¼ teaspoon minced fresh medium-hot chili<br>
								Salt and pepper to taste<br>
								3 minced garlic cloves<br>
								¼ teaspoon thyme<br>
								¼ teaspoon crushed coriander seeds<br>
								<br>
								<b>How to Make Khinkali:</b><br>
								<br>
								<ol>
								<li>Use your hands to mix the flour, egg, water, and salt together. If needed and the dough is too sticky, add more flour. If the dough is too dry, add more water. Flour a surface and knead the dough for 3 minutes until it is smooth and stretchy.</li>
								<li>Put the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover it with a tea towel.</li>
								<li>Use your hands to mix all of the meat filling ingredients in a deep bowl. Ensure that you break down all of the meat and incorporate everything well.</li>
								<li>Make the dumplings in batches; divide the dough into thirds. Sprinkle a surface with flour. Roll a ball with one third and roll it out into the thickness of ¼ inch.</li>
								<li>Using a glass or circular cookie cutter about 2.5-3 inches in diameter, cut the amount of circles that will fit, using excess dough to add to the remaining dough.</li>
								<li>Make each circle larger by rolling them out into 4-inches in diameter. Put a spoonful of meat filling into the center of the circle, pleating the edge, gathering it, and pinching the top edges together. To ensure the khinkali is sealed well, you can pinch and twist the top. Set all khinkali on a lightly floured surface.</li>
								<li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Take a large spoon to carefully lower the khinkali into the pot, stir the khinkali without piercing them to ensure they do not stick to the bottom. Boil the khinkali for about 10 minutes. Serve hot, sprinkled with pepper. Eat with your hands.</li>
